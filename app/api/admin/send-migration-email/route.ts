    body: (firstName: string) => `Hi ${firstName},

Quick follow-up on your upgraded Rooftops AI account.

The new platform has been live for a week and early users are loving it:

💬 "The AI proposals alone save me 2 hours per job" — Mike R., Dallas
💬 "My close rate went from 30% to 55% with the professional reports" — Sarah C., Denver

Your free access is still waiting: https://rooftops.ai/login

  week3: {
    subject: "[Last call] 72% of beta users switched to the new platform",
    body: (firstName: string) => `Hi ${firstName},

The numbers are in from our beta:

📊 72% of users who tried the new platform stayed
📊 Average time saved: 12 hours/week
📊 Average close rate increase: +35%

The new Rooftops AI is objectively better — but I need you to see it yourself.

Your 3 free months expire in 7 days: https://rooftops.ai/login

If the new platform doesn't blow you away, keep using the old one. No pressure.

I need your help deciding the future direction:

👉 I'm switching to the NEW platform: https://rooftops.ai/login
👉 I'm staying on the CURRENT platform: Reply "keep legacy"
👉 I need help deciding: Reply and let's chat

Your feedback shapes what we build next.

Thanks,
Steele
