## Iteration 1

### US-0: Codebase Discovery and Pattern Analysis ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Commit**: be72708

**What was implemented**:
- Thoroughly examined the rooftopsgpt codebase
- Identified tech stack: Next.js 14 App Router, Supabase, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
- Documented file structure: /components, /lib, /db, /app/api, /types
- Identified existing patterns for modals, auth, database, API responses
- Created CODEBASE-PATTERNS.md with comprehensive documentation

**Key Discoveries**:
- Subscriptions table already exists with Stripe integration
- Feature_usage table already exists for tracking usage
- Stripe webhook and checkout already configured
- Modal pattern uses Radix Dialog with custom styling
- Auth uses Supabase Auth with @supabase/ssr
- Toast system uses Sonner
- Existing subscription limits differ from PRD requirements

**Adaptations Made**:
- Will need to modify existing subscription limits to match PRD (US-1)
- Will use existing subscriptions/feature_usage tables instead of creating new ones
- Will follow existing Radix Dialog pattern for modals
- Will use existing Stripe integration

**Learnings for Future Stories**:
- Always check /db directory for existing database query patterns
- Use /lib/supabase/server.ts for server-side auth
- Follow existing modal patterns in /components/ui/dialog.tsx
- Use toast from 'sonner' for notifications
- API routes should use NextResponse.json

### US-1: Database Schema & Migrations ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Commit**: 319caf3

**What was implemented**:
- Created migration `20260112_add_tier_system_usage.sql`
- Added `user_usage` table with columns: user_id, month, reports_generated, chat_messages_premium, chat_messages_free, web_searches, last_chat_date, daily_chat_count
- Added `tier` column to subscriptions table (alias for plan_type for PRD consistency)
- Created indexes for performance
- Added RLS policies for security
- Created `/db/user-usage.ts` with query functions:
  - `getUserUsage()`, `getOrCreateUserUsage()`
  - `incrementReportUsage()`, `incrementChatUsage()`, `incrementWebSearchUsage()`
  - `resetDailyChatCount()` for daily limit resets

**Patterns Used**:
- Followed existing Supabase migration pattern in `/supabase/migrations`
- Used existing RLS policy patterns
- Created database query functions in `/db` directory matching existing patterns
- Used service role Supabase client for database operations

**Adaptations Made**:
- Kept existing `subscriptions` table, added `tier` column alongside `plan_type`
- Created new `user_usage` table instead of modifying `feature_usage` (kept both for compatibility)
- Updated status values to match PRD ('active', 'cancelled', 'past_due')

**Learnings**:
- Migration will be applied when Supabase is running locally (Docker needed)
- Service role client needed for server-side database operations
- UNIQUE constraint on (user_id, month) prevents duplicate records

---

### US-2: Tier Management Service ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Commit**: 7e05808

**What was implemented**:
- Created `/lib/entitlements.ts` with all required tier management functions
- `getUserTier(userId)`: Returns user's tier or 'free' as default
- `checkReportLimit(userId)`: Checks report generation limits
- `checkChatLimit(userId)`: Checks chat limits and returns appropriate model
- `checkWebSearchLimit(userId)`: Checks web search limits
- `checkAgentAccess(userId)`: Checks agent library access
- `getUserUsageStats(userId)`: Helper to get complete usage overview
- Defined `TIER_LIMITS` constant with all tier limits from PRD

**Tier Limits Implemented**:
- Free: 1 report, 5 chat/day (GPT-4o), 0 web searches, no agents
- Premium: 20 reports, 1000 messages/month (GPT-4.5-mini) + unlimited GPT-4o, 50 web searches, agents enabled
- Business: 100 reports, 5000 messages/month (GPT-4.5-mini) + unlimited GPT-4o, 250 web searches, agents enabled

**Patterns Used**:
- Put service in `/lib` directory following existing patterns
- Used `getSubscriptionByUserId` from existing `/db/subscriptions.ts`
- Used functions from `/db/user-usage.ts` created in US-1
- Handles month rollover automatically (creates new record if needed)
- Handles daily rollover for free tier (checks last_chat_date)

**Adaptations Made**:
- Check both `tier` and `plan_type` fields for backward compatibility
- Default to 'free' tier on errors for safety
- Chat limit returns which model to use (GPT-4.5-mini or GPT-4o)
- Includes `switchedToFreeModel` flag when premium messages exhausted

### US-3: Usage Tracking Utilities ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE (Already implemented in US-1)
**Reference**: db/user-usage.ts from US-1

**Note**: All required usage tracking functions were already created in US-1:
- `incrementReportUsage(userId)`: Increments report count atomically

- Returns proper error code (REPORT_LIMIT_REACHED) when limit exceeded

**Features**:
- Before generating report: Check authentication → Check report limit → Generate or show error
- After successful generation: Increment usage counter
- API returns remaining count: "X reports remaining this month"
- Free users: After 1st report, shows upgrade modal on subsequent attempts

### US-11: Agent Usage Check Backend Enforcement ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Commit**: f8654a3

**What was implemented**:
**Backend (/app/api/agents/generate/route.ts)**:
- Replaced old `requireFeatureAccess` with `checkAgentAccess()` from entitlements
- Returns 403 error with `PREMIUM_REQUIRED` for free tier users
- Error includes clear message: "Agents are available on Premium and Business plans"
